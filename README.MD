I love the UX and easability of notion so building my own was a great project to tackle. Learning how to create a rich text-editor with the ability to edit inline blocks was such a challenge. I had to work with content-editable elements to allow the user to write and change the look of the block to headings, bullet or append bookmarks to. 

I Used React context for the state management and learned a more modular and cleaner approach to the folder structure of my code.
